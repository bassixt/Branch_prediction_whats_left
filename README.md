### IMPORTANT : current qemu version => stable-2.7
* Modified file can be found on src_qemu/
* First branch predictor can be located on src_qemu/Reader_prog
    * Some assumptions : 
        * Bimodal
        * No tag only mod(n) for addressing
        * If wrong decision => replace the entry
        * If wrong decision => replace address

    * https://github.com/sjdesai16/tage

### Eighth week:
  * Branch prediction improvements:
    * Tagging the branch predictor using an hash-table
        * http://www.partow.net/programming/hashfunctions/http://www.partow.net/programming/hashfunctions/ 
  * Understand the the code in order to find out wether the branch is taken or not
    * http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26748224/how-qemu-knows-the-branch-direction-of-a-tb-which-had-been-executed 
        * COMMENTS: Even if we are using wrong prediction (always not taken branches, that's false), changing from mod(n) to hash function we have noticed that a reduction of performances passing
from mod -> 99.150002 hash -> 98.790474.
Even if it could seems worse, it's an improvement since this mean that we are replacing less time the same location in the branch predictor (and so since we are using bimodal BP, we reach the right prediction "always taken" later) because the index brings
to different location. This lead to decrement in a slower way the counter of each taken leading to an higher missprediction rate.


### Ninth week:
  * Found a way to print all the branches (Hope so) code can be found under Files/src_qemu
     * QEMU is a dynamic recompiler. The code runs once, and it generates recompiled code that potentially runs multiple times. The generated code contains a jump at the point of the gen_goto_tb.
  * Start to implement LTage or other BP.
     * Usefull websites:

### <a name="NetworkforQemu"></a>Network for Qemu
To exchange datas with the emulated system we use tftp.To create a tftp server:
Packet required:
```
sudo apt-get install xinetd tftpd tftp
sudo apt-get install isc-dhcp-server
sudo apt-get install bridge-utils
```
Create this file under /etc/xinetd.d/ called tftp (as example with the command)
```
sudo vim /etc/xinetd.d/tftp
```
cutting and pasting the following lines inside
```
service tftp
{
protocol        = udp
port            = 69
socket_type     = dgram
wait            = yes
user            = nobody
server          = /usr/sbin/in.tftpd
server_args     = /tftpboot
disable         = no
}
```
Create the following folder and execute the following commands
```
sudo mkdir /tftpboot
sudo chmod -R 777 /tftpboot
sudo chown -R nobody /tftpboot
```
Now you can restart the service with the following commands:
```
sudo /etc/init.d/xinetd stop
sudo /etc/init.d/xinetd start
```
Now to create a suitable network for the emulator create and run the following script:
(WARNING: change user value with yours in my case was mc and nic with the name of your ethernet interface in my case was enp2s0)
```
user=mc
tap=tap0
bridge=br0
nic=enp2s0

echo "---> Creating taps..."
ip tuntap add dev $tap mode tap user $user
ip link set dev $tap up

echo "---> Creating bridge..."
brctl addbr $bridge
brctl setfd $bridge 0
brctl addif $bridge $nic
brctl addif $bridge $tap

echo "---> Bringing interfaces and bridge up..."
ifconfig $tap 0.0.0.0 promisc up
ifconfig $nic 0.0.0.0 promisc up
ifconfig $bridge 192.168.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 up

echo "---> Restart DHCP server"
service isc-dhcp-server restart
```
Now if everything went good run the qemu instance:
(WARNING: this file must be in the root directory in which there are all the other directories with qemu busybox and so on.)
```
ramfs_img		=	$(PWD)/busybox.cpio.gz
kernel_img		=	$(PWD)/linux/arch/arm64/boot/Image
qemu_root = $(PWD)/qemu
qemu_src = $(qemu_root)/src
qemu_build = $(qemu_root)/build
qemu_dtc =  $(qemu_src)/dtc
mon_ip		= 192.168.0.25
tel_ip		= 192.168.0.1
mon_port	= 2222
init_mem	= 1024M

run:
	script /tmp/run -c '\
		stty intr ^] && \
		$(qemu_build)/aarch64-softmmu/qemu-system-aarch64 \
		-M virt \
		-m $(init_mem) \
		-nographic \
		-cpu cortex-a57 \
		-kernel $(kernel_img) \
		-initrd $(ramfs_img) \
		-netdev tap,id=net0,ifname=tap0,script=no,downscript=no \
		-device virtio-net-device,netdev=net0,mac="52:54:00:12:34:50" \
		-append "earlyprintk console=ttyAMA0 loglevel=8 ip=$(mon_ip)" \
		-serial stdio \
		-monitor telnet:$(tel_ip):$(mon_port),server,nowait,nodelay \
		'

# XXX: QEMU monitor - open from a separate terminal
monitor:
	telnet $(tel_ip) $(mon_port)

# XXX: QEMU help
help:
	$(qemu_build)/aarch64-softmmu/qemu-system-aarch64 \
		-M virt \
		-help
```
Now to exchange data with the qemu machine:
To download a file (in QEMU)
```
tftp -g -r <filename> 192.168.0.1
```
To upload a file (from QEMU to Host)
```
tftp -p -r <filename> 192.168.0.1
```
